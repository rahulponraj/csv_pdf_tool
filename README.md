1. The project can make run using npx nodemon app.js or node app.js.
2. The proper channeling of the project running is consoled. So the way of traveling is clearly mentioned in the console.
3. The bug no1 is - The pdf is generating with the csv data but not with the uploaded template. I have coded in the sense is there any error create a new pdf. The path of the 
previous uploaded template is not been getting recognized.
4. The reason why i create a new pdf (secondary) is to check the proper data is updating in the pdf or the database updation is done or not. Both are working csv data is integrated and 
the database will get updated.
5. The bug no2 is - The preview will be updated on the screen and the pdf will be there in the uploads directory of the project. The preview in the screen is not the valid pdf of the client
its not accessible. The reason for this I checked the pdf is been converting base64 code encoding and decoding. The encoded pdf format is wrong I checked the base64 code in online compilers
it shows its not a valid code.
6. The overall project walkthrough is -- after uploading the files, it will be in the uploads directory and after generating the new updated pdf will also be there in the same.
The sample files is there in the uploads directory PLEASE CHECK.
