1. The project can be run using npx nodemon app.js or node app.js.
2. The proper channeling of the project running is consoled. So the way of traveling is mentioned in the console.
3. bug no1 is - The pdf is generating with the csv data but not with the uploaded template. I have coded in the sense that if is there any error create a new pdf. The path of the 
previously uploaded template is not been recognized.
4. The reason why I created a new pdf (secondary) is to check if the proper data is updated in the pdf or if the database updation is done or not. Both are working csv data is integrated and 
the database will get updated.
5. The bug no2 is - The preview will be updated on the screen and the pdf will be there in the uploads directory of the project. The preview on the screen is not the valid pdf of the client
it is not accessible. The reason for this I checked the pdf which has been converting base64 code encoding and decoding. The encoded pdf format is wrong I checked the base64 code in online compilers
it shows it's not a valid code.
6. The overall project walkthrough is -- after uploading the files, it will be in the uploads directory, and after generating the new updated pdf will also be there in the same.
The sample files are there in the uploads directory PLEASE CHECK. In case of error saving files please delete files in the uploads directory or use new filename.
